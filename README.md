Minditor is a block-level rich text editor that prioritizes both the end-user editing experience and the developer experience. It boasts the following features:

1. It provides essential components and plugins, such as image uploading and markdown commands, which are continuously improved by the official team. The goal is to offer a user experience that matches professional editing tools by default.
2. It supports InlineBlock for inline insertion.
3. Editor Blocks/InlineBlocks can be implemented with components from any framework.
4. Beyond common events and APIs, the Plugin system also offers developers a set of important reactive states by default, simplifying the development of Plugins.
